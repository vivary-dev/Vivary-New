# 12: Implement none, Git, and Jujutsu identity adapters
Type: outcome
Status: in-progress
Blocked-by: [03, 06]
Unlocks: [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 29]

Execution: Read and claim the live [GitHub issue](https://github.com/vivary-dev/Vivary-New/issues). Its dependencies govern starting work. Use [the graph](../graph.md) for supporting references. Parent dependencies still gate outcome completion, not independent preparation.

## Goal

Report and operate within the selected VCS mode while assigning one mutation owner for no-VCS, Git, Git worktree, monorepo, and colocated Jujutsu cases.

## Context

Program context: [design](../design.md), [migration](../migration.md), [release](../release.md), and [evidence](../evidence.md).

Own VCS capability adapters and fixtures. Read `design.md` filesystem rules and Jujutsu evidence. Keep repository host behavior in ticket 13. Unsupported layouts remain read-only or external-tool paths.

## Done condition

Detection distinguishes no VCS, Git repository, linked worktree, shared monorepo, Jujutsu workspace, and colocated Jujutsu. The adapter exposes only proven operations and serializes shared repository mutation.

## Verify

Run fixture tests for every layout, nested project roots, shared common directories, dirty state, detached state, and ambiguous ownership. Verify the no-VCS path never promises branch or merge rollback.


Run the [canonical common planning checks](../execution-contract.md#maintaining-the-graph)
after changing this outcome's metadata. These checks validate planning documents;
they do not prove the behavior above.

## Next packet

[12h](../packets/12h-core-root-custody-integration.md) integrates the existing
Linux root custody implementation into canonical Vivary. Its
[receipt](../receipts/12h-core-root-custody-integration.md) owns source review and
focused verification. Root recovery, Jujutsu, and mutation fencing remain open;
this integration does not complete the parent outcome.

## Log

- 2026-09-05: Initial public plan recorded. Implementation has not started.

- 2026-09-06: Packet 12a accepted a storage-neutral observation contract and
  expected fixtures after independent review. No adapter implementation or
  physical fixture execution occurred. Required inspection checks passed.
  The receipt retains a separate Windows planning-test newline failure.

- 2026-09-12: Began canonical integration of the reviewed Linux root observer,
  lifecycle owner, and private provider under packet 12h.
