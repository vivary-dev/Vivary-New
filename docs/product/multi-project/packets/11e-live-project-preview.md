# 11e: Preview and debug a running project with the agent
Type: packet
GitHub-issue: https://github.com/vivary-dev/Vivary-New/issues/31
Parent: 11
Status: needs-info
Depends-on: [04a]
Owner: Root-assigned project preview and Native browser-tool integrator
Scope: Connect a project's running page and supported browser debugging to its existing agent session.
Verification-kind: runtime
Needs: Project session binding accepted.
Timebox: One real preview, inspect, repair, and refresh loop using existing browser owners.

## Goal

The linked GitHub issue owns task scope and acceptance. This packet records
implementation boundaries. Work with the agent while seeing and debugging the
site or dashboard being built in the selected project.

## Existing implementation

`BrowserPreview.tsx` accepts a URL and renders an isolated iframe with refresh
and a new-tab fallback. It does not start a server or provide integrated browser
inspection. The Electron shell already includes Chromium. Inspect supported Native
browser and execution APIs before selecting another dependency or browser process.

## Context

Read the live GitHub issue, [the release snapshot](../desktop-release.md), and
[Native ownership](../native-owners.md). Preserve the existing architecture and
accepted evidence while implementing the issue's current requirements.

## Owned files

- Existing Workbench BrowserPreview and project-bound preview state.
- Supported Native browser tools and deterministic action adapters, when needed.
- Existing project execution/process controls for a configured development command.
- Desktop browser integration only where the existing shared surface is insufficient.
- Existing preview and project-scope tests.

## Implementation boundaries

Bind the development process, preview address, and debugging results to the selected
host and project session. Starting a command requires the existing execution authority.
Templates and preview URLs grant no extra permission. Stop only owned processes.

Expose supported page inspection, screenshots, console errors, and useful failed
request details through the real agent tools. Keep unsupported operations explicit.
Preview content must remain isolated from privileged app APIs, Node access, and
credentials. Do not borrow a personal browser profile or its cookies.

The shared surface must work at narrow widths. Packet 23d owns phone-to-host
connection and authenticated preview routing. This packet can implement and verify
the preview on the existing authorized host before the phone connection is accepted.
Final acceptance combines both. Do not introduce a duplicate browser automation layer.

## Done condition

The issue's acceptance passes through the normal app: run a small existing project,
inspect a visible/browser-reported failure, make an authorized correction, and see
the corrected live preview. Results stay in the owning project session. Switching
projects, unavailable previews, blocked embedding, and process shutdown are usable.
A basic iframe or fabricated browser result does not complete this feature.

## Verify

Use a bounded existing web fixture and supported browser tools. Exercise the useful
repair loop plus the affected project, process, isolation, and responsive UI cases.
Repeat failed journeys after repair. Preserve the existing test runners and limits.

```console
pnpm --dir packages/workbench exec tsx --test tests/workbench-preview.test.ts
pnpm --dir packages/workbench typecheck
```

## Stop conditions

Do not expose a service, bypass authentication, copy personal browser credentials,
or enable paid or scheduled work through this ticket. Preserve existing user
files, private state and historical evidence. Unsupported browser capabilities
remain unaccepted until demonstrated through a supported interface.

## Log

- 2026-09-13: Added from Jeff's live website/dashboard preview and debugging request.
  Existing iframe source is established. Integrated agent debugging is unimplemented.
