# Action catalog

This catalog enumerates 120 declared actions across the known product scope. IDs are stable review references, not shipped endpoints. Actual action names stay with the existing implementation owner. The JSON [feature map](feature-map.json) owns the inventory. This table is its readable projection.

## Shared action contract

Every action binds the user/organization, selected host and stable project where relevant. Reads enforce current authorization. Effects revalidate scope and expected versions immediately before execution. A visible selection is not authority. Viewing content never submits it to a model automatically.

Modes describe the initiating path: `read` is observation, `local` is deterministic application or filesystem work, `agent` is interpretation/work through the existing conversation runtime, and `external` can involve an account, connection or publication. These modes are not permission grants. The original operation owner still determines actual effects and required approval.

Scope labels describe the design: `release` participates in the selected desktop/browser experience, `later` belongs to the retained broader program, and `optional` has a working skip path. New controls proposed within a release family still require acceptance under their linked live issue. Labels never claim availability.

Each operation specifies a request ID, current source references and expected revisions where it can cause a durable effect. Results distinguish completed, denied, unavailable, conflict, failed and uncertain. A retry must reconcile the prior operation before repeating effects. Pending/failed persistence retains visible input and an explicit recovery. External side effects require their specific authority.

## States inherited by every action

| State | Required visible behavior | Required invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Loading | Layout-matching skeleton. Preserve selected project and input | Never infer empty or success |
| Empty | Explain the absence and one relevant next action | Do not seed fake projects, agents or content |
| Unavailable | Name missing capability with Retry/setup where supported | No silent fallback |
| Denied/revoked | Explain scope of refusal without leaking protected content | Start no new effect |
| Conflict | Show which revision/path changed and recovery options | Preserve both authored inputs and current source |
| Failed | Stable reason and safe Retry when possible | No fabricated receipt |
| Uncertain | Explain what may have happened and reconcile | Never automatically replay a possible effect |
| Canceling | Keep Stop status visible until cleanup is observed | No new conflicting execution |
| Complete | Show actual result and source references | A model response alone is not workflow acceptance |
| Reopen/restart | Restore durable refs/drafts and reconcile active work | No implicit approval or duplicate execution |

## Accessibility and interaction profile

Every applicable action has a text label, keyboard operation, visible focus, and an announced result. Pointer resizing also has keyboard controls. Escape closes only the top transient view and returns focus. At 390 px and 200% zoom the requested panel can take focus while Back returns to the same conversation. Essential approval and Stop remain reachable. Light and dark appearances retain readable contrast. These are acceptance requirements, not claimed accessibility certification.
